This repository contains some sample programs for working with the MNIST data 
set. It is intended primarily as an exploratory playground for investigating 
the inner workings of multi-layer neural networks and evaluating performance 
of various changes.

The MNIST data sets are available from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. That 
page also documents the file formats.
